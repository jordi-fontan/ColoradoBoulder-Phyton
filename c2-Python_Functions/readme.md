## WEEK 1: Hello, functions!

>Welcome on board! This first module shows the reasons why we need functions and introduces basic function definitions. 
You are going to recall some functions we have learned before, and you are going to define some simple functions of your own! Are you ready? Let's go!

## WEEK 3: Functions with Return Values
>For data science projects, not only we need to execute some functions, but also we expect some results from the execution so we can use the results for next step. This module introduces you the functions with return values. Are you ready? Let's go!

## WEEK 4: Functions in Functions

>With the knowledge you have learned about simple functions, functions with parameters, and functions with return values, you should be able to learn nested functions. This module introduces you the general idea of nested functions, as well as two specific categories of them: hierarchical functions and recursive functions. Are you ready? Let's go!
